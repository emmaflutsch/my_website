title: Are Movie Ratings a potential predictor of Gross Earnings?
---

As part of an analysis done on movies, based on IMDB data, we looked at the relationship between movie ratings and  earnings. We divided the data by genre.
For genres most popular with the general public, ratings do seem to be an indicator of a movie's performance at the box-office. This is especially clear with Action and Adventure movies, but also relevant for Comedies and Dramas; as the ratings increase, so do the gross earnings. We can infer that budget also plays an important part in the movies' ratings. This is especially true for genres that tend to have big productions, such as Action and Adventure. For instance, some data points have mid-ratings yet bring in high earnings whilst having a bigger budget.
There are also some genre with very few data points as there were not many in the dataset, which should have been excluded from the analysis.
