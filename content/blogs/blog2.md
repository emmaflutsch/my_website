title: Analysing countries' GDP split in R
---

As part of our coursework at London Business School, we looked at they way the Gross Domestic Product of three countries - Germany, India and the United States - is split over time, from the 1970 to 2010. 

"Looking at Germany’s GDP breakdown, it’s interesting to note that household expenditures kept a quite steady proportion throughout the whole period, except around the 2008 financial crisis, of which the impact is quite noticeable for all three countries, with Germany’s gross capital formation also having a clear dip around that time. Germany being the only out of the three countries that is part of the European union, it is also interesting to note their exports increasing after the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties were put into place. On a different note, we would also expect the reunification of the west and east Germanies to have a clear impact on the proportion of government expenditure, yet there does not seem to be.

India’s GDP breakdown is quite different from Germany’s. The 2008 financial crisis is quite noticeable as well and seems to particularly have impacted exports, as other countries lost disposable income. It is interesting to note that the government expenditure is around 15% of the GDP throughout the whole period, yet that gross capital formation gains a bigger proportion whilst the proportion of household expenditure keeps on decreasing. We can infer that this is due to a growing population, with increased inequalities; bigger companies and more billionaires, but also more poverty, resulting in less household expenditure.

The United States’ GDP split also showcases the impact of the 2008’s financial crisis, for instance with the Federal Reserve’s help towards the bank creating a small red bump in the late 2000s, early 2010s. Overall, government expenditure’s proportion kept on decreasing as republicans were in office, reducing government spending. It is interesting to note that other major financial crisis did not really impact the way the GDP is split up (2001, 1987)."
