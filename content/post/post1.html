<p>Originally from Paris, I moved to the United Kingdom at 18 to pursue an undergraduate degree in Management at Warwick University. There, I got involved within a student society - Line - whose aim is to raise funds for UNICEF whilst hosting events about fashion and art. I became President of the Society and managed a team of 30 people.
As part of my degree, I also undertook a placement year during which I interned within the luxury e-commerce industry, more specifically at Monnier Freres and Gisele Delorme. There, I familiarised myself with the industry and particularly enjoyed the challenges and possiblities that came with its face-paced environment.
After graduating from Warwick Business School, I worked as a Data Analyst for British Airways as part of their graduate program; having no previous background in analytics, I received extensive training and worked on exciting projects, which you can find out more about in the next section of the website.
Wanting to consolidate my analytical skills and bridge the gap between analytics and business acumen, I joined London Business Schoolâ€™s Master in Analytics.</p>
